# NTUEE 2024 DClab
It's NTUEE DClab. In most files, we clearly separate the combinational logic and sequential logic, with simple annotations, we believe anyone who is interested in DE2115 or FPGA can easily understand what our codes want to implement.

In lab2, we implement **RSA256 decoder**, we also handle RS232 protocol.

In lab3, we implement an **Audio Recorder**, we handle I2S, and I2C protocol, with the communication to WM8731 to help receive and send out the voice signal. We utilize SRAM with 2MB data to store the digital signal of the voice, with the extension of LCD.
